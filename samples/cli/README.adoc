= Home Assistant cli in Quarkus (`hass-qli`)

This is an early, simple, and straightforward implementation of a command-line interface (CLI) for https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant-cli[Home Assistant] using https://quarkus.io[Quarkus]. 

Do NOT use this for anything serious and do NOT expect it to work nor is the code/structure anywhere near final.

== Requirements

. A Long Lived Access token for your Home Assistant instance. You can get it from the bottom of your profile page in Home Assistant.

. Download the latest native binary or jar from the https://github.com/maxandersen/home-assistant-qli/releases/tag/early-access[Early Access release]
+
If you have https://jbang.dev/[jbang] installed you can also install it directly from github:
Â±
[source,shell]
----
jbang app install hass-qli-early-access@maxandersen
----

Now setup your token as an environment variable:

[source,shell]
----
export HASS_TOKEN=your-token
----

and if necessary set the url to your Home Assistant instance:

[source,shell]
----
export HASS_URL=http://localhost:8123
----

By default it will use `http://homeassistant.local:8123` as the url.

== Basic usage examples

List all state

[source,shell]
----
hass-qli state list
 ID                                                             STATE
 ðŸ‘¤ person.max_rydahl_andersen                                  not_home
 ðŸ’¡ light.stars                                                 on
 ðŸ’¡ light.kitchentable_group_light                              on
 ðŸ’¡ light.hall_group_light                                      off
 ðŸ’¡ light.house                                                 on
 ðŸ’¡ light.partyroom_entrance                                    off
...

You can put a filter after the list command to filter the list:

[source,shell]
----
hass-qli state list camera
 ID                                                   STATE
 ðŸ“½ camera.mail_usps_camera                           idle
 ðŸ“½ camera.mail_amazon_delivery_camera                idle
 ðŸ”˜ binary_sensor.camera_motion                       off
 ðŸ“¦ sensor.camera_battery                             100
 ðŸ“¦ sensor.camera_volume                              11
 ðŸ”Œ switch.camera_siren                               off
 ðŸ“¦ sensor.mac_macbook_active_camera                  unknown
 ðŸ”˜ binary_sensor.mac_macbook_camera_in_use           off
 ðŸ“¦ sensor.darkbeard_active_camera                    Inactive
 ðŸ“¦ sensor.camera_last_activity                       unknown
 ðŸ”˜ binary_sensor.darkbeard_camera_in_use             off
 ðŸ“¦ sensor.camera_last_motion                         unknown
 ðŸ“¦ sensor.manderse_mac_active_camera                 Inactive
...
----

The filter is a regular expression so you can do more advanced targeted filtering.
The following is example of showing only where the ID starts with `camera`. Note that quotes are needed to avoid the shell to expand the expression:

[source,shell]
----
hass-qli state list "^camera"
 ID                                     STATE
 ðŸ“½ camera.mail_usps_camera             idle
 ðŸ“½ camera.mail_amazon_delivery_camera  idle
 ðŸ“½ camera.carbonshaper_camera          recording
 ðŸ“½ camera.front_door_doorbell_sub_2    idle
 ðŸ“½ camera.camera1_sub                  idle
 ðŸ“½ camera.driveway_2_sub               idle
 ðŸ“½ camera.max_office_sub               idle
 ðŸ“½ camera.camera_5_sub                 idle
 ðŸ“½ camera.side_door                    unavailable
 ðŸ“½ camera.front_door                   unavailable
 ðŸ“½ camera.front_door_doorbell_sub      unavailable
 ðŸ“½ camera.barn_outdoor_sub             idle

There are more commands available, but they are not documented yet. You can see them by running `hass-qli` without any arguments.

== Background

Around 2018/2019 I started to use Home Assistant and I really liked it. I also started to
move forward the hass-cli python project (https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant-cli) to 
the extent it had several releases and became really useful for me. You can read more about it link:https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2019/02/04/introducing-home-assistant-cli/[here] and even got on the podcast link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8AQrlfwfCg[here].

However, I went on a sabbatical and got to work on other things. I also got back to using Java and
just didn't have the time to work on the hass-cli project. 

Now some years later I'm back to using Home Assistant and hass-cli recently haven't had working releases
and xmas 2024 I really wanted to have a working cli for Home Assistant. So I decided to start a new Java
based on using Quarkus.

Thus this is not trying to displace hass-cli but rather be a new alternative. 

Not sure where it will go but at least I have a working cli for my own use now and I have a way to test Quarkus developer experience.

The advantages of using Java is that its dependencies are much easier to manage and does not conflict with other Python dependencies. Meaning that even 5 years from now this code shuold be able to run without any issues - assuming HomeAssistant API is still the same.
